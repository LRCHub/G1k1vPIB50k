I don't care what you might say,
I'm gonna become the way
I was meant to feel the world,
oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh
So give yourself another try,
compromise your own mind
Leave me be and finally see all
the reasons why, why
We'll keep together and oh, make
it better
We'll keep together and oh, make
it better
So you see it's you and me and
everybody in between
Doesn't matter if we're green
oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Straining out the body we're
sending for the starting gate
This day might turn okay, it
will be okay, oh okay
We'll keep together and oh, make
it better
We'll keep together and oh, make
it better
We'll keep together and oh, make
it better
We'll keep together and oh, make
it better
Keep together, keep together,
oh. Let it roll. Let it roll
Keep together, keep together,
oh. Let it roll. Let it roll
Keep together, keep together,
oh. Let it roll. Let it roll
Keep together, keep together,
oh. Let it roll. Let it roll
We'll keep together and oh, make
it better
We'll keep together and oh, make
it better
We'll keep together and oh, make
it better
We'll keep together and oh, make
it better
