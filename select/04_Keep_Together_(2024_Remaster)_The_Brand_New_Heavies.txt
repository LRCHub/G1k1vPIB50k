Life ain't so easy sometimes
Things tend to block up my mind
Stop me from Living how I want to live
I've been working so hard
Trying to play the right card
Haven't had the time to
Do the things I needed to
Why am I feeling so blue
This feeling isn't new
I should have listened to the
Words my friends would say
They'd say when times are rough you
Know you've got hold on hold on
Sometimes when you feel like giving up
You know you've got to keep together keep together keep together
And I know when thing get kind of rough
You know you've got to keep together keep together keep together
I know it's happened before
Trouble it knocked at my door
It filled my head with things
I didn't seem to understand
Bad luck it followed me to
Whatever I would do
I seemed to ruin all things
I wanted most of all
Why am I feeling so blue
This feeling isn't new
I should have listened to the words my friends would say
They'd say
When times are rough you know you've got to hold on hold on
'Cause everywhere that you go and everything that you do
Situations they will try to get the better of you
Whatever happens to you this time you've got to hold on to it hold on
Baby now
